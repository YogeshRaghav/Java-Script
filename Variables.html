      1. var

      (These pointers apply for the same scope)
      - Re-declaration is allowed
      - Re-initialization is allowed
      - Re-assignment is allowed
      - Global Scope

      2. let

      (These pointers apply for the same scope)
      - Re-declaration is not allowed
      - Re-Initialization is also not allowed
      - Re-assignment is allowed
      - Block scoped ***

      3. const

      (These pointers apply for the same scope)
      - Re-declaration is not allowed
      - Re-Initialization is also not allowed
      - Re-assignment is not allowed
      - Block scoped ***

      4. When to Use var, let, or const?
      
      - Always declare variables
      - Always use const if the value should not be changed
      - Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)
      - Only use let if you can't use const
      - Only use var if you MUST support old browsers.
